# nvim + latex

## Introduction

Here there are 2 things to have in mind while trying to work with LaTeX and NeoVim at the same time.

1) LaTeX requires compilation, which turns `.tex` files into multiple formats, including `pdf`. To compile I'll be using `latexmk`.

More of that here : http://personal.psu.edu/jcc8//software/latexmk-jcc/

To install it
```bash
sudo apt install latexmk -y
```


2)  One of the best plugins to use alongside nvim to work with latex is called `vimtex`.
